## Problem Statement
The challenge at hand is to develop a web application, named CreativeSongCraft, that enables users to generate original song lyrics and convert them into playable sheet music. This project aims to combine artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques, and music theory to provide users with an innovative platform for creative music composition.

## Solution
CreativeSongCraft is an AI-powered web app that offers users the ability to create unique song lyrics and transform them into professionally notated sheet music. The app utilizes AI-generated Markov chain lyrics and the ChatGPT API for refining and enhancing the lyrical content. The LilyPond library is employed to convert the perfected lyrics into sheet music notation that can be played by various instruments.

## Tech Stack Used
- Backend Development: Python, Flask
- AI Integration: Trained LSTM model for Lyrics generation and ChatGPT API for final rendering
- Lyrics Generation: Markov Chain Modeling
- Sheet Music Generation: LilyPond Library
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
